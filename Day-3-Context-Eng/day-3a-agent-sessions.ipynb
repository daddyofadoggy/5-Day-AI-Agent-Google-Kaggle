It's one of the most impactful areas where AI is making a difference in healthcare. Here are some key trends and recent advancements:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **What's new:** This is a huge area of growth. Instead of just screening existing databases, generative AI models can now *design* entirely new molecules with specific properties. Think of it like an AI architect that can invent a building from scratch, rather than just pick from pre-designed blueprints.\n*   **How it works:** These models learn the rules of molecular structure and chemistry from vast datasets and then generate novel chemical structures that are predicted to bind to a specific disease target.\n*   **Impact:** This has the potential to unlock new classes of drugs that might not have been conceived of through traditional methods.\n*   **Examples:** Companies like **DeepMind (AlphaFold's successor, now Isomorphic Labs)**, **Exscientia**, and **Insilico Medicine** are heavily investing and reporting successes in this space. They are designing molecules for various targets, including those that have been historically \"undruggable.\"\n\n**2. AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **What's new:** AI is getting much better at sifting through massive amounts of biological data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, clinical data) to identify novel disease targets that were previously unknown or overlooked.\n*   **How it works:** AI can find complex patterns and correlations that humans might miss, revealing new pathways involved in disease and potential points for therapeutic intervention.\n*   **Impact:** This expands the pool of potential drug targets, leading to more diverse and potentially effective treatment options.\n*   **Examples:** Researchers are using AI to analyze population-level genetic data to link specific genes or proteins to diseases.\n\n**3. Predicting Drug Properties and Efficacy:**\n\n*   **What's new:** AI is becoming more sophisticated at predicting how a potential drug will behave in the body (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics), its toxicity, and its likelihood of success in clinical trials, *before* it's even synthesized or tested extensively.\n*   **How it works:** Machine learning models are trained on data from past drug development failures and successes to identify patterns that predict these outcomes.\n*   **Impact:** This helps de-risk drug development by filtering out unpromising candidates early on, saving significant time and resources. It also allows researchers to optimize drug properties for better efficacy and safety.\n\n**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **What's new:** AI is accelerating the process of finding new uses for existing approved drugs.\n*   **How it works:** By analyzing drug-drug interactions, disease pathways, and molecular structures, AI can identify existing medications that might be effective against different diseases.\n*   **Impact:** Drug repurposing is often faster and cheaper than developing a new drug from scratch, as the safety profile of the drug is already known.\n*   **Examples:** AI has been used to identify existing antivirals that could be repurposed for new viral threats, or to find cancer drugs that could treat other conditions.\n\n**5. Streamlining Preclinical and Clinical Trials:**\n\n*   **What's new:** While not strictly discovery, AI is also being applied to make the *testing* of discovered drugs more efficient.\n*   **How it works:** This includes using AI to optimize clinical trial design, identify suitable patient populations, predict patient response to treatment, and even analyze trial data more effectively.\n*   **Impact:** This can lead to faster, more successful clinical trials and quicker access to new treatments for patients.\n\n**Key Players and Trends to Watch:**\n\n*   **AI-Native Biotech Companies:** Companies like **Recursion Pharmaceuticals**, **BenevolentAI**, **Exscientia**, **Insilico Medicine**, and **Atomwise** are built around AI-driven drug discovery.\n*   **Big Pharma Partnerships:** Major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly partnering with or acquiring AI drug discovery startups to leverage their capabilities.\n*   **Focus on Specific Diseases:** Many AI drug discovery efforts are targeting challenging areas like neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), rare genetic disorders, and difficult-to-treat cancers.\n*   **Open-Source AI Models:** The release of powerful AI models (like AlphaFold) is democratizing access to AI tools for researchers worldwide.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just an incremental improvement in drug discovery; it's a fundamental shift that is dramatically increasing the speed, efficiency, and success rate of bringing new medicines to patients.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the **second development** I mentioned: **AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation**. This is a critical and often overlooked step in drug discovery, and AI is bringing significant advancements here.\n\nLet's break it down further:\n\n**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n\nBefore we dive into AI, it's important to understand what a drug target is. In most cases, a drug target is a specific molecule within the body that plays a role in a disease process. This is often a **protein** (like an enzyme, a receptor, or a structural protein), but it can also be a **gene** or even a specific **RNA molecule**.\n\nThe idea behind drug discovery is to find a drug that can interact with this target to:\n\n*   **Inhibit** its activity (e.g., an enzyme that's overactive in a disease).\n*   **Activate** its activity (e.g., a receptor that's underactive).\n*   **Block** its interaction with other molecules.\n*   **Degrade** it.\n\n**The Traditional Challenge of Target Identification:**\n\nHistorically, identifying and validating drug targets has been a slow, painstaking, and often serendipitous process. It involved:\n\n*   **Deep scientific understanding:** Relying on the knowledge and hypotheses of expert biologists.\n*   **Laboratory experiments:** Conducting countless experiments to test hypotheses.\n*   **Literature review:** Sifting through thousands of research papers to find clues.\n*   **Uncovering complex biological pathways:** Diseases are rarely caused by a single factor. Understanding the intricate network of interactions within cells and the body is incredibly difficult.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification:**\n\nAI, particularly machine learning, excels at finding patterns and relationships in massive, complex datasets. This is precisely what's needed to tackle the challenges of target identification. Here's how AI is making a difference:\n\n1.  **Analyzing \"Omics\" Data:**\n    *   **What it is:** This refers to high-throughput biological data such as:\n        *   **Genomics:** DNA sequences of individuals.\n        *   **Proteomics:** The complete set of proteins produced by an organism.\n        *   **Transcriptomics:** The complete set of RNA transcripts produced by an organism.\n        *   **Metabolomics:** The complete set of small molecules (metabolites) in a biological sample.\n    *   **AI's role:** AI algorithms can process these vast datasets to identify genes, proteins, or metabolites that are consistently altered in diseased states compared to healthy states. They can find subtle correlations that might indicate a crucial role in the disease.\n\n2.  **Integrating Diverse Data Sources:**\n    *   **What it is:** AI can combine information from different sources that would be impossible for a human to synthesize:\n        *   Scientific literature (PubMed, research papers).\n        *   Clinical trial databases.\n        *   Electronic health records (anonymized).\n        *   Publicly available biological databases (e.g., protein interaction networks).\n    *   **AI's role:** By building comprehensive knowledge graphs and applying natural language processing (NLP), AI can draw connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of information, suggesting novel targets.\n\n3.  **Predicting Causality, Not Just Correlation:**\n    *   **What it is:** A key challenge is distinguishing between molecules that are merely *associated* with a disease (correlational) and those that actually *drive* the disease (causal).\n    *   **AI's role:** Advanced AI models are being developed to infer causal relationships, helping researchers prioritize targets that are most likely to be effective therapeutic intervention points.\n\n4.  **Identifying Novel Biological Pathways:**\n    *   **What it is:** Diseases often involve complex dysregulation of multiple biological pathways.\n    *   **AI's role:** AI can map these complex networks and identify key nodes or switches within pathways that, if targeted, could restore balance and treat the disease.\n\n**Benefits of AI-Driven Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Speed:** Dramatically accelerates the identification process.\n*   **Novelty:** Uncovers targets that might have been missed by human researchers or traditional methods.\n*   **De-risking:** Helps prioritize targets with a higher probability of success, reducing wasted effort on less promising avenues.\n*   **Breadth:** Enables the exploration of a wider range of potential targets across many diseases.\n*   **Personalization:** Can help identify targets that are specific to certain patient subgroups, paving the way for precision medicine.\n\n**Examples in Action:**\n\n*   **Company Focus:** Many AI drug discovery companies dedicate significant resources to their target ID platforms. For instance, **BenevolentAI** has a platform that integrates and analyzes vast amounts of biomedical data to identify novel targets.\n*   **Specific Disease Areas:** AI is being used to find targets for difficult diseases like Alzheimer's by analyzing brain imaging data and genetic profiles, or for rare genetic diseases by linking specific gene mutations to observable symptoms.\n\nIn essence, AI is empowering scientists to explore the vast, uncharted territories of human biology more effectively, uncovering the root causes of diseases and pointing the way to new medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the key players in the AI-driven drug discovery space, specifically those focused on **target identification and validation**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
